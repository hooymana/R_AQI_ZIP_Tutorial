# R_AQI_ZIP_Tutorial
This is a repository that includes AQI and PM2.5 data from all sites in the US for the year 2021 and R code to merge zip code data with that AQI data based on proximity to each site.

The AQI folder contains all data for every site within each state including Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Washington DC for the year of 2021.

The EPA_AQI.R script uses different R accessible API's to get longitude and latitude data for each participant zip code that is then linked based on minimum proximity.

Check out the tutorial where I walk you through how to use the data and the script provided
